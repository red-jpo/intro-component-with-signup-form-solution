## Final Notes

It's been a while since I last used Grid; Flexbox has been my go-to, so it was a nice reminder that there are different layout options to explore. This project wasn't complex, but it led to a ton of research. I had my first peek into constraint validation features and how to include them. I found it pretty useful. The JavaScript was quite simple this time, but it was also a first, as I had to implement email format validation. I thought of adding an email verification feature, so I looked into it, but since it requires APIs, I won't be doing that this time. I haven't gotten to that module yet, and I'm focused on taking things one step at a time. I've learned a lot from this project, and I'm pleased with the outcome.
