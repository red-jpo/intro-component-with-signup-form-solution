## Final Notes

First dive into the world of Git, and let me tell you, it was quite the adventure. Initially, I found it a bit overwhelming, but with some persistence and a little trial and error, I quickly got the hang of it. While working on this project, I did encounter a few hurdles, particularly when it came to tweaking the sizing adjustment in the media queries. It was a bit frustrating, but I eventually struck the right balance. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and I believe I successfully fulfilled all the requirements of the challenge.
